# MyList

Simple full-stack to-do list, created in Visual studio. To run locally execute the .sql as a query in Visual Studio to create db, then copy all other files in project dir and build.

The app currently implements simple login/logout functionality using session variables, as well as simple db queries such as select, insert and delete.

As this is my first web app with c#, source code in current version is probably a bit sloppy. It will get better in time. :)
