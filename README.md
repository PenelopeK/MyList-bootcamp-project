# MyToDoList

Simple full-stack to-do list, created in Visual studio. To run, execute db.sql to create database, 
then insert Model and Model.Context files into app_code directory inside project directory, then
all other files in project directory.

The project implements simple login/logout functionality using session variables, and simple db requests
such as select, insert and delete.
