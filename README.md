# MyToDoList

Simple full-stack to-do list, created in Visual studio. To run locally, copy all files in project dir, then build via Visual Studio.

The project implements simple login/logout functionality using session variables, and simple db queries such as select, insert and delete.
As this is my first web app with c#, source code in current version is probably a bit sloppy. It will get better in time. :)
